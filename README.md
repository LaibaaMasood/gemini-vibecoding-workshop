# Gemini SDK Workshop — VibeCoding Notebook

Welcome to the official repository for my modified version of the Gemini SDK workshop notebook! This repo contains a hands-on walkthrough using Google's Gemini SDK to generate AI responses in a creative and interactive way.

## 🚀 About

This project was built as part of a workshop experience where participants explored the capabilities of the Gemini SDK using Python. I have added my own twists and improvements to enhance the functionality and vibe of the original notebook.

### ✨ Features

- Gemini SDK Integration
- Prompt engineering examples
- Text generation using multimodal AI
- Streamlined inputs and responses
- Creative modifications for personalization

## 📓 Notebook Preview

The Jupyter notebook (`gemini_vibecoding.ipynb`) contains:
- Setup and authentication for the Gemini SDK
- Custom prompts and input/output formatting
- Gemini response generation examples
- Fun experiments and vibe-enhanced prompts
